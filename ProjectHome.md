Dungeoneer is a screensaver.  Dungeoneer is also a game.  It's both, actually; it's a game designed to be automatically played by "itself" in the form of a screensaver.  Dungeoneer draws its inspiration from the various automatic roguelike players such as the [Angband Borg](http://itctel.com/~apwhite/andrew.html).  In addition to the screensaver mode, Dungeoneer will also have an executable with an auto-play mode that mas the same effect as the screensaver and can also be manually played.  Dungeoneer is a Roguelike game, in this context meaning a game featuring randomly generated dungeons traversed by a hero who only has one life, only one chance for success.  Death by either the screensaver or the player playing will invalidate the current game and force a restart.  For more on Roguelikes, see [RogueBasin](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).

Dungeoneer is written in C# for the .NET 3.0 framework for computers running Windows XP.  This is the only platform the program is currently guaranteed to run correctly on at the time of release.  Other platforms may be developed later and may actually run at the time of the original release, but this is coincidental.
